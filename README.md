### About Our Space, Our Place

“Society’s perception of the blind is either you are a superhero/have super powers, or you can’t do anything.” -Cheryl Cumings, director of OSOP

Our Space, Our Place (OSOP) is a place for students who are blind/visually impaired to explore the options available to them. They give opportunities for students to explore things like art, dance, and career opportunities. Our role is to give OSOP students experience working with STEM.

Our goal is to inspire and empower students to find uses for STEM in their lives through access to our STEM kit and activities.

#### Design Values
* Accessibility of Teaching
* Engage with multiple learning styles
* Give students experience in team settings

#### Our STEM Kit
 (alt text: A drawing of our STEM kit. Inside a large bin are six smaller bins, as well as several batteries, wheels, and foam blocks.)

#### Instructions

Our STEM activities should be teachable by anyone, not just us. Making the instructions and teaching methods accessible is just as important as the accessibility of the activity itself.

The instructions, accessible by screen reader, include component and layout descriptions as well as activity instructions and STEM learning connections.

Printed instructions allow for some students to act as helpers during the activity.

#### Components

The kit contains supplies for students to learn STEM through open-ended robot building. Students engage with STEM through:

* Understanding how basic motors/circuits work
* Learning how to integrate electronics into a robot
* Engaging creatively in robot design
* Connecting STEM/robotics to real-life challenges

### Teaching Model

There are many interactions involved in successfully running the STEM activity. We’ve outlined the roles that we, the instructor, and the students each play.

Us (Designers)
* Provide kit components to instructor
* Provide instructions to instructor
Instructor
* Teach the activity to students
* Troubleshoot issues students have
Students
* Help each other during the activity
